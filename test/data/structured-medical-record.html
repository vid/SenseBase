 Brief History of Present Illness: This is a 4 year old female with history of
 asthma who presented to the ED for increased work of breathing for 2 days.
 Associated symptoms included dry cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and
 tactile fever. Patient initially improved on home nebulizer treatments of
 albuterol until mother ran out of medication. Hospital Course: Patient
 required continuous nebulization treatments in the ER and had an oxygen
 requirement of 6L. Once patient transferred to floor, she tolerated 5mg Q2 hr
 treatments x 2. Her oxygen requirement decreased to 2 L via nasal cannula. She
 was weaned to room air within the first 24 hours and her treatments were
 spaced to 2.5mg q2 hr. She was found to have allergic rhinitis on exam and was
 prescribed singulair, which she tolerated. We offered a nasal corticosteroid,
 which Mom refused due to difficulty with patient cooperation. Nutrition
 evaluated patient and educated parent. The ward team also discussed healthy
 choices and exercise with mom as well as provided asthma education and action
 plan.
