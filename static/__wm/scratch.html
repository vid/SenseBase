          The United States, Germany and probably other nations will soon hold talks on American surveillance tactics that include alleged spying on European allies.

          Amid reports that the U.S. has bugged various embassies and missions, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had what sounds like an uncomfortable discussion by phone on Wednesday, the White House reported.

          "The President assured the Chancellor that the United States takes seriously the concerns of our European allies and partners," said a White House statement on the call.

          The White House said Obama and Merkel agreed to "a high-level meeting of U.S. and German security officials in the coming days" to discuss surveillance issues disclosed in news leaks by former government contractor Edward Snowden.

          The two leaders also support a United States-European Union "dialogue" on the "collection and oversight of intelligence and questions of privacy and data protection," said the White House.

          EU officials have expressed outrage over news reports on the activities of the National Security Agency.

          Obama and Merkel "reaffirmed the importance of continued close cooperation between our respective intelligence services in the fight against terrorism and other threats to the security of the United States, Germany, and our allies," the White House said.

          The leaders also discussed trade issues and the deaths of 19 firefighters in an Arizona wildfire.

          The White House readout:

          "President Obama spoke by phone today with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who offered condolences on the tragic deaths of 19 firefighters in Arizona.

          "The President and the Chancellor discussed the recent reports of surveillance activities allegedly conducted by the U.S. National Security Agency. The President assured the Chancellor that the United States takes seriously the concerns of our European allies and partners.

          I definitely believe in opiates for this type of therapy. I think they should be legal for this, they're the best antidepressant ever! An issue I think of would be tolerance. Provided you have a prescription that won't get you randomly shut off, addiction will be only an uncomfortable thought at most (no withdrawals if you have your dose). I'm just concerned that in the long-term tolerance would prevent you from getting therapeutic effects. Taking tolerance breaks from months of opiate use can be hard because of withdrawals.

          For the past couple of years I have experienced pain on and off in the lower right side of my rib cage that goes from the front to my mid back. Over this time period, I have had about 4 sonnagrams, 1 ct scan, 2 chest x-rays, blood work which says my enzymes are normal(the latest being on Monday night) and I know I don't have hepititis b/c I give blood at NIH every other month (they screen for that). The doctors have checked my liver, pancreas, kidneys and gall bladder and all are fine. My frustration is that I have and the doctors have no idea what the pain may be. Everyone is claiming it is pulled muscles on my side. I know this is not a mental problem. Does anyone have any idea what it could be or if there is anything that I should be tested for? Please let me know b/c I am going crazy trying to figure out what the heck the problem is.

          By the way, the pain occurs mostly after I have had something to drink. I don't think that is the problem b/c Sunday I drank some wine at dinner and then a few beers, Monday had the pain and that is when I went to the hospital and they told me my liver enzymes were normal and all the other tests (sonnagram and x-ray) were normal.
